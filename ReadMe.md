# TCS-Programs-using-command-line
Collection of mostly asked programming questions in TCS during various hirings.

For quick reference what is command line arguments and how to use them in c:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/


To access the command-line argument inside a java program is quite easy, they are stored as string in String array passed to the args parameter of main() method.

/*
class cmd
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    for(int i=0;i< args.length;i++)
    {
    System.out.println(args[i]);
    }
  }
}
//Execute this program as java cmd 10 20 30
*/
